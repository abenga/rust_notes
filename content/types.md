# Rust Data Types

## Scalar Types

Represent a single value.

### Integers

These are whole numbers. Rust has the following built-in integer data types:

* **8-bit numbers**

| Data Type | Min Value | Max Value |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `i8`      |    $-128$ |     $127$ |
| `u8`*     |       $0$ |     $255$ |

\* generally used for byte values (e.g. streams read from a file or a socket).

* **16-bit numbers**

| Data Type | Min Value | Max Value |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| `i16`     | $-32,768$ |  $32,767$ |
| `u16`     |       $0$ |  $65,535$ |

* **32-bit numbers**

| Data Type |           Min Value          |           Max Value           |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `i32`     | $-2,147,483,648$ ($-2^{31}$) |  $2,147,483,647$ ($2^{31}-1$) |
| `u32`     |                          $0$ |  $4,294,967,295$ ($2^{32}-1$) |

`i32` is the default integer size in Rust.

* **64-bit numbers**

| Data Type |  Min Value  |  Max Value  |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `i64`     |   $-2^{63}$ |  $2^{63}-1$ |
| `u64`     |         $0$ |  $2^{64}-1$ |

* **128-bit numbers**

| Data Type | Min Value |  Max Value  |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
|    `i128` |$-2^{127}$ | $2^{127}-1$ |
|    `u128` |       $0$ | $2^{128}-1$ |

* **Architecture dependent numbers**

| Data Type |   Min Value  |   Max Value   |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
|   `isize` | $-2^{(w-1)}$ | $2^{(w-1)}-1$ |
|   `usize` |          $0$ |     $2^{w}-1$ |

Here, ${w}$ will be the word size of the platform in bits. For example, 64 on
64-bit machines. These are usually used when indexing some sort of collection.

### Signed Integers

Signed numbers are stored using *two's complement* representation. This is 
where a number's most significant bit (called the *sign bit*) has negative sign. 
It has weight $-1 \times 2^{(w - 1)}$ where ${w}$ is the size of the number in 
bits.

For an 8-bit number, -128 as bits would be:

```
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
```

-1 would be

```
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

and 127 would be

```
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
```

### Literals

You can use a suffix to identify the type of an integer literal, e.g. `62u8`.
We can use the prefixes `0x`, `0o`, and `0b` in hexadecimal, octal, and binary
literals.

To aid readability when typing out literals, we can separate digits using
underscores, e.g. to group thousands, e.g. `9_876_543_210`.

### Integer Overflow

If an operation whose result is to be stored in an integer results in a value
greater than the type's maximum size, we say that *integer overflow* occured.
If we are compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow
that cause the program to panic at runtime, but when compiling in release mode,
Rust performs *two's complement wrapping*, where the values wrap around to the 
minimum value that the type can hold. The program will not panic, but the 
variable will have a different value than expected.

Rust provides ***wrapping***, ***checked***, ***overflowing***, and 
***saturating*** methods to explicitly handle the possibility of overflow.

### Casting

We can convert from one integer type to another using the `as` operator.

```rust
assert_eq!(10_i8 as u16, 10_u16);
```

Conversions that are out of range for the destination produce values that are
equivalent to the original modulo $2^N$, where $N$ is the width of the
destination in bits.


### Floating-Point Numbers

These are numbers with decimal points. Rusts's floating-point types are `f32`
and `f64`, which are 32 and 64 bits in size respectively. `f64` is the default
floating point type. All floating point types are signed.

Floating point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The
`f32` type is a single-precision float, and `f64` has double precision.

### Booleans

The Boolean type has two possible values: `true` or `false`. They are one byte
in size.

```rust
let f: bool = false;
```

Possible operations on boolean values are *logical not* (`!b`), *logical or* (
`a | b`), *logical and* (`a & b`), *logical xor* (`a ^ b`), and *comparisons* (
`a == b`, `a != b`, `a > b`, `a < b`, `a >= b`, or `a <= b`).

Unlike in other languages that couldassign the concept of "truthiness" to other
types, boolean values are the only types that are usable in contexts where a
Boolean type is required, e.g. as the condition in an `if` statement.

Rust uses an entire byte for a `bool` value in memory, though it only requires
a byte, so that we can create a pointer to it.

## Compound Types

These group multiple values into one type.

### Tuples

A tuple groups together several values with a variety of types into one compound
type. Fields of tuples are named using increasing numeric names matching their
position in the list of types.

```rust
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;  // Use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value.
let first = tup.0;  // You can accesss a tuple element directly as t.0, t.1, ...
```

Rust code may use tuple types to return multiple values from a function, from
which we can use pattern-matching destructuring to assign each element of the
return value to another variable.

A tuple without any elements goes by ***unit***. It's value and type are written
`()`. It represents an empty value or an empty return type. Various expressions
will produce a unit value if there is no other meaningful value for it to
evaluate to. It is the implicit return type for a function which has no
meaningful return value.

## Arrays

An array is a fixed-size collection of multiple values that all have the same
type. The type of an `N`-sized array of elements of type `T` is written as 
`[T, N]`. The size is a constant expression that evaluates to a `usize`.

```rust
// stack-allocated array.
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// heap-allocated array, coerced to a slice
let a: Box<[i32]> = Box::new([1, 2, 3]);  // see pointers/box

let a = [3; 5]  // Repeats the value 3 5 times.

// Getting ith element in the array
let i: usize = 0;
let first_el = a[i];  // panics if index is not in array.

let ith_el = a.get(i); // Returns Option<i32>, containing `Some(val)` if a val
                       // exists at index i, `None` if i is out of bounds.
```

## Textual Types

`char` and `str` can hold textual data.

### The `char` type

The `char` type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type. Rust `char`
types are four bytes (32 bits) in size and represent a Unicode Scalar Value.

```rust
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

A `char` is a unicode scalar value, represented as a 32-bit unsigned word. It
is undefined behaviour to define a `char` that falls outside the defined ranges
of Unicode code points (0x0000 to 0xD7FF or 0xE000 to 0x10FFFF). Rust uses the
type system and dynamic checks to ensure `char` values are always in the
permitted range.

### The `str` type

A `str` is a slice of 8-bit unsigned bytes (it is represented the same way as 
`[u8]`). Rust standard library methods working on `str` assume and ensure that
data in a `str` is valid UTF-8. Since `str` is a dynamically sized type, it can
only be instantiated through a pointer type, such as `&str`.

## Pointer Types

These are types that represent memory addresses.

### References

References are Rust's basic pointer type. It can point to a value on the stack
or the heap. A reference to a variable x is written as `&x`, and has type `&T`,
where `x: T`. Given a reference `r`, the expression we get the value that it
points to using the expression `*r`.

A reference does not automatically free the data it points to when it goes out
of scope. Types are immutable by default, i.e. `&T` is the type of a mutable
reference to a variable of type T. Mutable references have the type `&mut T`.
There can be any number of immutable references to a variable or one mutable
reference. Never both.

### Boxes

A box is a pointer that points at a value on the heap.

### Raw Pointers

Raw pointers are unsafe pointers. Rust does not track what they point to, and
they may be null, or point to already freed memory. They are just like C
pointers, with all the attendant issues.
